            <div class="body">MSG or monosodium glutamate is a known food additive and flavour enhancer, 
                commonly linked to Chinese and Japanese cuisine. It is naturally found in 
                small amounts in some foods such as tomato and cheese, but more known as a 
                flavour enhancer utilised in Chinese cuisine to provide a distinct taste.</div>

            <div class="body2">
        MSG was first discovered in 1907 by Japanese chemist Kikunae Ikeda,
        from foods like Tomato and Asparagus and extracting the glutamate with
        a mixture of water and salt. By the 1950s it was being sold in America
        in bottles, where it was heavily associated with Chinese cuisine.

            <div class="body2">
                In 1968, the New England Journal of Medicine published a letter 
                from a doctor whocomplained about muscle pain, particularly
                after eating Chinese Cuisine. He suggested that MSG, cooking 
                wine or excessive salt were to blame, similar responses were 
                recorded from readings and therefore a common blame towards 
                MSG was born. This caused MSG to become a bit of a scapegoat 
                to these issues, creating the 'Chinese Restaurant Syndrome' 
                where many who were not used to the food felt the effects. 
                Early on, researchers blamed MSG for the similar symptoms 
                that the doctor experienced, even when there were flaws to
                the claim as many who consumed it without knowledge often 
                did not experience the symptoms.
             </div>
            <div class="body2">
                By 1995, the FDA (Food and Drug Administration) released a 
                report from the Federation of American Societies for 
                Experimental Biology which stated that MSG is safe for 
                consumption at small quantities which was similar to that 
                used in Chinese Cuisine. This however did not necessarily
                change the story, where many still felt that MSG was the 
                culprit for the negative effects and still succumbed to 
                the Restaurant Syndrome.

        <div class="subtitle">The rumours of MSG</div>

        <div class="body">The information surrounding MSG could also be attributed to the mistrust 
            towards Chinese cuisine and its people, as there could definitely be a connection 
            between racial prejudice and the theory. It could also be considered that a new 
            substance to a country can be often blamed for any problems, as MSG had little 
            information about its health effects at the time, leading to theories and fear to 
            be spread about its attributes. The Chinese Restaurant Syndrome can definitely be 
            linked to any racial bias America had at the time, seeing certain food as different 
            and blaming a newer substance for its negative effects.</div>

        <div class="body">Papers and articles from trusted figures certainly reinforced the 
            negative rumours surrounding MSG, where many complained and blamed MSG, it caused 
            many to share the same opinion. It also did not help that experts like doctors condemned 
            the compound, as opposed to researching and finding the real reason for these symptoms 
            within Chinese cuisine. Therefore people often blamed the unknown compound of MSG. 
            The compound of MSG did not have that much research put into it at that time, making 
            it seem untrustworthy in comparison to known flavour enhancers.

            <div class="body">The supposed MSG side effects are often found with no real link to 
                the consumption of MSG. In the 1990s, The FDA asked the Federation of American Societies 
                for Experimental Biology to look into the effects and overall safety of MSG. They noted 
                that there were little effects and any effects were very mild and short-lived, and these 
                were typically associated with large doses of MSG without any food. 
                
                In saying that it could be common for those who are not used to the substance to have 
                some type of reaction, similar to if you were to consume a new food after years without 
                consumption. Therefore small amounts of MSG will not likely have any negative side effects.
